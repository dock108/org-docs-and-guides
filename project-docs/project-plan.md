# Project Plan for Sports Score Predictor and Stock Market Simulator Apps

## Step 1: Local Environment Setup

1. **Install Development Tools**:
   - Install the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store for Swift development.
   - Install Visual Studio Code for Python and other scripting tasks.
   - Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed on your macOS.

2. **Set Up Version Control**:
   - Install Git if not already present on your macOS.
   - Configure your GitHub account and SSH keys for secure access.

3. **Database Installation**:
   - Install MongoDB locally and set it up to run as a service.
   - Ensure you have a GUI tool like MongoDB Compass for easier database management.

4. **Dependency Managers**:
   - Verify that pip is installed for Python package management.
   - Familiarize yourself with Swift Package Manager through Xcode for managing Swift dependencies.

## Step 2: Repository Setup

1. **Initialize Git Repositories**:
   - Create two separate GitHub repositories, one for each app.
   - Clone these repositories to your local machine.

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - For each repo, set up a directory structure separating the source code (`src`), tests (`tests`), and documentation (`docs`).

3. **Initial Commit**:
   - Make an initial commit with the basic directory structure.

## Step 3: Backend Services Setup (Python/Flask)

1. **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment**:
   - In each project repository, create a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

2. **Install Flask and Required Libraries**:
   - Activate the virtual environment and install Flask, along with other libraries like Pandas and Sci-kit Learn.

3. **Basic Flask Application**:
   - Create a simple Flask application with a basic route for health check.

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Set up Swagger for documenting your APIs.

## Step 4: Frontend Setup (SwiftUI)

1. **Create a New Xcode Project**:
   - In each repository, start a new SwiftUI project in Xcode.

2. **Basic UI Components**:
   - Develop initial views for the main screens of the apps.

3. **Swift Package Dependencies**:
   - Add necessary Swift packages for additional functionality like charts.

## Step 5: Development Workflow and Branching Strategy

1. **Agile Methodology Adoption**:
   - Plan your development sprints and tasks using GitHub Projects.

2. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Implement a feature branching strategy: Create `develop`, `feature/`, `bugfix/`, and `release/` branches as needed.

## Step 6: CI/CD and Testing Setup

1. **GitHub Actions Configuration**:
   - Set up GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Configure it to run tests on every push and pull request.

2. **Testing Frameworks**:
   - Set up XCTest in Xcode projects for Swift testing.
   - Configure PyTest for the Flask applications.

## Step 7: Security Measures

1. **Basic Security Setup**:
   - Ensure HTTPS is used for all API communications.
   - Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication in your Flask apps.

2. **Database Security**:
   - Implement secure, role-based access control in MongoDB.

## Step 8: Initial Local Testing

1. **Run and Test the Backend**:
   - Test the Flask applications locally to ensure they run correctly and the routes are accessible.

2. **Frontend Integration Testing**:
   - Test the integration of the SwiftUI frontends with the Flask backends.

3. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write and run initial unit tests for both the frontend and backend components.

## Step 9: Preparing for Deployment

1. **Cloud Environment Selection**:
   - Choose a cloud platform like Google Cloud for hosting.
   - Plan for database migration to MongoDB Atlas.

2. **Containerization**:
   - Begin Dockerizing the Flask application for easier deployment.

3. **Deployment Scripting**:
   - Write scripts for automated deployment to the cloud environment.

## Step 10: Documentation

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Ensure that all code is well-documented, explaining functions, methods, and classes.

2. **Project Documentation**:
   - Update the `docs` folder with setup guides, architecture descriptions, and API usage.

## Final Note
- This plan is iterative; steps will be revisited and refined as the project progresses.
- Regular commits and documentation updates are essential to maintain project clarity and continuity.
